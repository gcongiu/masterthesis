Also, we describe how$\backslash$nthe parallel language extensions, though simplifying the programming, do not$\backslash$naddress the performance problems found in parallel file systems. $\backslash$par We have$\backslash$ndevised an alternative scheme for conducting parallel I/O - the Two-Phase$\backslash$nAccess Strategy - which guarantees higher and more consistent performance$\backslash$nover a wider spectrum of data distributions. We have designed and implemented$\backslash$nruntime primitives that make use of the two-phase access strategy to conduct$\backslash$nparallel I/O, and facilitate the programming of parallel I/O operations. We$\backslash$ndescribe these primitives in detail and provide performance results which$\backslash$nshow that I/O access rates are improved by up to several orders of magnitude.$\backslash$nFurther, we show that the variation in performance over various data$\backslash$ndistributions is restricted to within a factor of 2 of the best access$\backslash$nrate.},

In response to this situation, Toshiba has been developing and supplying all of the main types of storage devices, including hard disk drives (HDDs), optical disc drives (ODDs), and solid-state drives (SSDs) using NAND flash memories. With the ongoing diversification of storage device market needs ranging from personal use to data centers, we are making efforts to accelerate several new technical innovations to meet a wide variety of storage requirements.},

\section{Introduction}

The gap between hard disk drives (HDDs) performance and CPUs computing capabilities, also known as the I/O gap problem, has been growing constantly in the last years and becomes particularly serious if we consider high-end computing clusters (HEC) having hundred of thousands or even millions of cores. 

Distributed parallel file systems (DPFSs) such as Lustre and GPFS try to bridge this gap by striping the data across multiple servers and providing multiple parallel data paths to increase the aggregate I/O bandwidth. The abstract device I/O interface (ADIO) driver in ROMIO~\cite{ThakurGL96}, an implementation of the MPI-IO library, enables file access optimizations, based on two-phases I/O and data sieving, that adapt I/O patterns generated by scientific applications to the underlying DPFSs~\cite{ThakurGL99}. 

Unfortunately, as Carns et al. have pointed out in their study~\cite{CarnsHABLLR11}, the majority of applications they analyzed still use inefficient POSIX I/O interface to access the data. It has also been demonstrated~\cite{ChingCLP06} that using POSIX I/O to access non-contiguous regions of files, brings to extremely poor performance in the case of networked file systems such as the parallel virtual file system (PVFS2). This is due to the high volume of requests going through the network and, of course, because of the intrinsic nature of HDDs that predilige sequential access patterns.

At the moment there is no available solution to fix non-optimal I/O patterns generated by scientific applications but re-write them {\color{red} (? to be checked...ATC USENIX....!)}. The Linux kernel provides programmers with the capability to communicate access pattern information to the file system through the system call \texttt{posix\_fadvise}~\cite{AdviseAPI}. The file system can use this information to improve caching performance, for example, by pre-fetching data that will be required soon in the future or by disabling read-ahead in the case of random read patterns. The problem is that \texttt{posix\_fadvise} is barely used and has intrinsics limitations that discourage its employment in reality.\\
In this paper we propose to use \texttt{posix\_fadvise} to fix access patterns at run-time. We generate advice for the file system on behalf of applications using what we call Advice Manager (AM). I/O activity is monitored using an interposing library we wrote and passed to the AM that generates advice using the \texttt{posix\_fadvise} system call. The advantage with our approach {\color{red} (is this the advantage over all other possible solutions out there??!)} is that we can generate advice for applications that do not use them but can take benefit from them. We accomplish this in full asynchronism, with very low overhead, and absolutely no modification of the original application.\\
We demonstrate that our approach is effective to improve the storage bandwidth, reduce the number of I/O requests and the running time of a data analysis framework, widely used by physicists at CERN, called ROOT~\cite{ROOT}.

The reminder of this paper is organized as follows.

%Some embedded literal typset code might 
%look like the following :
%
%{\tt \small
%\begin{verbatim}
%int wrap_fact(ClientData clientData,
%              Tcl_Interp *interp,
%              int argc, char *argv[]) {
%    int result;
%    int arg0;
%    if (argc != 2) {
%        interp->result = "wrong # args";
%        return TCL_ERROR;
%    }
%    arg0 = atoi(argv[1]);
%    result = fact(arg0);
%    sprintf(interp->result,"%d",result);
%    return TCL_OK;

%Now we're going to cite somebody.  Watch for the cite tag.
%Here it comes~\cite{Chaum1981,Diffie1976}.  The tilde character (\~{})
%in the source means a non-breaking space.  This way, your reference will
%always be attached to the word that preceded it, instead of going to the
%next line.

\section{This Section has SubSections}
\subsection{First SubSection}

%Here's a typical figure reference.  The figure is centered at the
%top of the column.  It's scaled.  It's explicitly placed.  You'll
%have to tweak the numbers to get what you want.\\
%
%% you can also use the wonderful epsfig package...
%\begin{figure}[t]
%\begin{center}
%\begin{picture}(300,150)(0,200)
%\put(-15,-30){\special{psfile = fig1.ps hscale = 50 vscale = 50}}
%\end{picture}\\
%\end{center}
%\caption{Wonderful Flowchart}
%\end{figure}
%
%This text came after the figure, so we'll casually refer to Figure 1
%as we go on our merry way.

\subsection{New Subsection}

%It can get tricky typesetting Tcl and C code in LaTeX because they share
%a lot of mystical feelings about certain magic characters.  You
%will have to do a lot of escaping to typeset curly braces and percent
%signs, for example, like this:
%``The {\tt \%module} directive
%sets the name of the initialization function.  This is optional, but is
%recommended if building a Tcl 7.5 module.
%Everything inside the {\tt \%\{, \%\}}
%block is copied directly into the output. allowing the inclusion of
%header files and additional C code." \\
%
%Sometimes you want to really call attention to a piece of text.  You
%can center it in the column like this:
%\begin{center}
%{\tt \_1008e614\_Vector\_p}
%\end{center}
%and people will really notice it.\\
%
%\noindent
%The noindent at the start of this paragraph makes it clear that it's
%a continuation of the preceding text, not a new para in its own right.
%
%
%Now this is an ingenious way to get a forced space.
%{\tt Real~$*$} and {\tt double~$*$} are equivalent. 
%
%Now here is another way to call attention to a line of code, but instead
%of centering it, we noindent and bold it.\\
%
%\noindent
%{\bf \tt size\_t : fread ptr size nobj stream } \\
%
%And here we have made an indented para like a definition tag (dt)
%in HTML.  You don't need a surrounding list macro pair.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[]  {\tt fread} reads from {\tt stream} into the array {\tt ptr} at
%most {\tt nobj} objects of size {\tt size}.   {\tt fread} returns
%the number of objects read. 
%\end{itemize}
%This concludes the definitions tag.

\subsection{How to Build Your Paper}

%You have to run {\tt latex} once to prepare your references for
%munging.  Then run {\tt bibtex} to build your bibliography metadata.
%Then run {\tt latex} twice to ensure all references have been resolved.
%If your source file is called {\tt usenixTemplate.tex} and your {\tt
%  bibtex} file is called {\tt usenixTemplate.bib}, here's what you do:
%{\tt \small
%\begin{verbatim}
%latex usenixTemplate
%bibtex usenixTemplate
%latex usenixTemplate
%latex usenixTemplate
%\end{verbatim}
%}


\subsection{Last SubSection}

%Well, it's getting boring isn't it.  This is the last subsection
%before we wrap it up.

\section{Acknowledgments}

%A polite author always includes acknowledgments.  Thank everyone,
%especially those who funded the work. 

\section{Availability}

It's great when this section says that MyWonderfulApp is free software, 
available via anonymous FTP from

\begin{center}
{\tt ftp.site.dom/pub/myname/Wonderful}\\
\end{center}

Also, it's even greater when you can write that information is also 
available on the Wonderful homepage at 

\begin{center}
{\tt http://www.site.dom/\~{}myname/SWIG}
\end{center}

Now we get serious and fill in those references.  Remember you will
have to run latex twice on the document in order to resolve those
cite tags you met earlier.  This is where they get resolved.
We've preserved some real ones in addition to the template-speak.
After the bibliography you are DONE.

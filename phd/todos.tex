Comments to the thesis from Andre'

The thesis should be self explainatory:
 - what is HPC 
 - what is MPI
 - what is ROMIO

 This would require an additional introduction for every chapter
 - the introduction will explain why the problem is important 
 - how I am approaching the problem 

For the Mercury for example I need to explain that in more details. Motivation section is fine.

There are no space limitation thus the thesis should be at least 100 pages and have at least 100 references
(Possibly increase the font and figures size, do not put figures one next to the other very tightly)

Add ADIOS and SIONlib to related work and other related work like collective caching in MPI etc.

There is too much code in the thesis move it to an appendix.

\chapter{Background on Guided I/O Intefaces}
In this chapter we present the state of the art in guided I/O interfaces for different software components of the I/O stack. Hints targeting different I/O parameters and mechanisms are presented and described in detail. Some of the presented hints will be useful to understand the design choices explored in the next chapters.

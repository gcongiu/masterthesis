\chapter{Background on Guided I/O Intefaces}
\label{chapter: guided-io}
In this chapter we present the state of the art in guided I/O interfaces for some of the software components in the I/O stack as we presented them in the introduction. Hints targeting different I/O parameters and mechanisms are presented and described in detail. Some of the presented hints will be useful to understand the design choices explored in the next chapters.
